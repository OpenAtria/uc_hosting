Aegir Ubercart Integration
--------------------------

THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE

This module provides several features to ubercart products on an Ã†gir platform.

Quick start instructions:
1. Enable all quota attributes
2. Generate a demo product class
3. Create a product in that class
4. Enable the hosting integration feature for that product

There is a git repo at http://github.com/sfyn/uc_hosting for the current HEAD.

Expect more documentation soon. I promise.
